# Debate 9 · Multi-agent debate

ROB 599 · Lecture 11 · Nov 11, 2026.

Debate 8's agents kept notes from their own attempts. ReasoningBank's agent also judged for itself whether each attempt had worked, and its judge agreed with the true outcome only 72.7% of the time. This one moves back one stage of the loop, to [verify](https://github.com/yayuanli-org/awesome-physical-ai/tree/main/courses/umich-26fall-rob599-physically-grounded-ai-agents/lectures/02-where-the-field-stands#26-verify-close-the-loop-on-what-happened), and hands the check to other agents. It opens two weeks on multi-agent AI. This week several copies of one model answer the same question, read each other's answers, and revise their own over a few rounds. Neither paper uses a robot, since only one of the hub's 42 robot papers puts more than one robot on a task. They differ on where the gain comes from: the talk between the agents, or the count of their answers.

| Multiagent Debate. Du et al., ICML 2024. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325) · [code](https://github.com/composable-models/llm_multiagent_debate) | The talk helps. Three copies of ChatGPT answer on their own, then read each other's answers and revise their own. On arithmetic, debate reaches 81.8% against 69.0% for a vote over the three first answers, and on grade-school math 85.0% against 81.0%. More agents and more rounds raised arithmetic accuracy, with no gain past four rounds. |
| Debate or Vote. Choi, Zhu and Li, NeurIPS 2025. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17536) · [code](https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/debate-or-vote) | The count does the work. It splits debate into its two parts, several agents and the talk between them. With Qwen2.5-7B, a vote over five agents' first answers averages 76.9% across seven benchmarks, above the best debate setup at 73.8%, and in most setups more rounds make debate worse. Under its model of how agents update their beliefs, it proves that talking leaves each agent's expected chance of being right where it started. |

## Theme debate

Motion: agents that argue reach better answers than agents that only vote.

- Arguing lets a right answer spread. In Multiagent Debate, debate beat the vote on arithmetic, 81.8% to 69.0%, and in some cases every agent started wrong and the group still finished right. But agents also argue each other out of right answers. In Debate or Vote, debate on arithmetic fell from 76% after two rounds to 67% after three, and Multiagent Debate reports groups that agree on a wrong answer and affirm it with confidence.
- Voting is simple and hard to beat. A vote needs only each agent's first answer. In Debate or Vote it averaged 76.9% against 73.8% for the best debate, and with a 32B model it still matched debate. But a vote only counts. It cannot fix a mistake most agents share, and on medical questions, agents given different roles beat the vote by debating, 84.2% to 82.4%.
- The motion asks whether the talk between agents adds anything that counting their answers does not.
